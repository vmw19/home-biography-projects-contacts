        <h3>My Projects</h3>
    <div class="container">
        <p> As an elementary educator with over a decade of classroom experience, I have worked in many school districts across the world. Most enjoyable was my time serving as an Exceptional Student Educator working with students with varying exceptionalities. Moving forward in my career, I have worked with over fifty school districts as a software developer designing school websites to include school calendars, events, fundraising pages, etc. Most recently, I designed a software program for students with below-average reading scores to help improve reading skills, including vocabulary and comprehension. The program is also used with English Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL). The software program is currently used in over one hundred school districts.

        <p> The following are a list of five of my major software development projects. These projects were created in partnership with a few of the largest school districts in the United States: New York School District (*over 1,800 schools), Los Angeles Unified School District (*over 660,000 students), and Puerto Rico Department of Education (*over 430,000 students) <div class=""></div>
